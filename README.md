##Task Title: Interactive Quiz Application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Objective:
The aim of this internship project was to create a fully functional and informative quiz web application based on fundamental web technologies‚ÄîHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app should have loaded dynamic questions, assessed user answers in real time, and given feedback depending on performance.

Description:
This quiz program is a responsive, browser-based program that enables users to respond to five multiple-choice questions. The quiz topics are varied, ranging from general knowledge subjects such as space (planets), global geography (capitals), food nutrition, historical inventors, and official languages.

The user interface has been kept in mind with a minimalist and clean design. The background of the web page has been set to dusty rose color, providing a warm and friendly ambiance. The quiz box is provided in a soft beige color, with rounded edges, and a fixed width equivalent to one-fourth of a standard laptop screen. This design keeps the quiz centered and visually balanced regardless of screen size.

Every question provides four choices, with a single correct one. If selected, the program offers immediate feedback in the form of highlighting correct and incorrect choices using color-coded responses (green for correct choice, red for incorrect choice). The other choices are disabled as soon as a choice is made or a time limit is reached, and the user can move on by clicking the "Next" button.

One of the standout features is the 15-second timer for every question. When no answer is chosen within the time, the correct one is displayed automatically. This creates a sense of urgency and interactivity to the experience.

On conclusion of the quiz, a final screen result appears displaying:
-Total number of correct answers out of 5
-Accuracy percentage
-A motivational message:
"Well done üëè " for scores 4 or 5
"Job done üëç " for lower scores

The whole application is executed in-browser without a backend, demonstrating competence in vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, timers, and dynamic UI updates.

Conclusion:
This project proves the capability to design, develop, and deploy an interactive front-end application independently while considering user experience, logic, and real-time¬†interaction.
